# Fix Issues Again Implementation

This branch addresses several persistent issues in the EmrickScents website. Below is a summary of the changes made:

## Issue 1: Homepage Overlap on Mobile

**Problem:** The homepage was extending horizontally on mobile devices, causing sideways scrolling.

**Solution:**
- Reinforced `overflow-x: hidden` on the main container in App.jsx by adding an inline style
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to the html element in index.css
- These changes ensure horizontal scrolling is prevented across all browsers and devices

## Issue 2: Google Maps Embed Fix

**Problem:** Google Maps embed was not displaying on Netlify due to Content Security Policy (CSP) issues.

**Solution:**
- Updated CSP in netlify.toml and netlify-preview.toml to include more comprehensive frame-src directives:
  ```
  frame-src 'self' https://www.google.com https://maps.google.com https://*.google.com;
  ```
- Added a `_headers` file in the public directory to ensure CSP is properly applied by Netlify
- This allows Google Maps iframes to load properly within the application

## Issue 3: Product Page URL

**Problem:** Product pages were using IDs in URLs instead of more SEO-friendly product names.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the slugify utility function to be more robust with error handling
- Improved the findProductBySlug function to handle partial matches as a fallback
- Updated the product finding logic in EnhancedProductDetails.jsx to handle edge cases
- Added fallback to ID-based lookup if slug-based lookup fails

## Issue 4: Product Page Slider

**Problem:** After deployment to Netlify, the swipe/arrow icons disappeared from the product page slider.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the custom CSS for Swiper in src/components/swiper-custom.css
- Added explicit content for navigation arrows using CSS content property
- Added explicit opacity and visibility properties to ensure arrows are visible
- Added custom navigation elements directly in the Swiper component
- Updated Swiper configuration with additional navigation options

## Testing

All changes have been tested and verified to work correctly. The website now:
- Displays properly on mobile without horizontal scrolling
- Loads Google Maps embeds correctly
- Uses SEO-friendly URLs for product pages with robust fallbacks
- Displays proper navigation icons on product page sliders
