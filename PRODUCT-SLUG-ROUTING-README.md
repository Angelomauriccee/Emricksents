# Product Slug Routing Implementation

## Overview
This update implements SEO-friendly product URLs using slugs derived from product names instead of numeric IDs. This makes product URLs more descriptive and user-friendly, which can improve SEO and user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Routing Configuration
- Modified `App.jsx` to prioritize slug-based routes
- Added `/product/:slug` as the primary route for product pages
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing routes

### 2. Enhanced Slugify Utility
- Improved the `slugify` function to ensure consistent slug generation
- Enhanced `findProductBySlug` to better handle edge cases
- Added `getProductUrl` utility function for generating product URLs

### 3. Updated Components to Use Slug-based URLs
- Updated `EnhancedProductCard` and `ProductCard` components to use slugs in links
- Modified `SearchOverlay` to use slug-based product links
- Updated `Cart` and `EnhancedCart` components to use slugs for product links

### 4. Improved Product Lookup Logic
- Enhanced `EnhancedProductDetails` component to properly handle slug-based navigation
- Implemented fallback mechanisms to handle legacy ID-based URLs
- Added automatic redirection from ID-based URLs to slug-based URLs

## Benefits
- **SEO Improvement**: URLs now contain descriptive product names instead of just IDs
- **User Experience**: URLs are more readable and meaningful to users
- **Maintainability**: Consistent slug generation across the application
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility with existing ID-based URLs

## How to Test
1. Click on product links throughout the site to verify they use slug-based URLs
2. Try accessing a product directly via its slug URL (e.g., `/product/bleu-de-chanel`)
3. Verify that old ID-based URLs still work and redirect to slug-based URLs

## Implementation Details
- Slugs are generated by converting product names to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing special characters
- When a product is accessed by ID, the user is automatically redirected to the slug-based URL
- If a product cannot be found by slug, the system attempts to find it by ID as a fallback
- If no product is found by either method, the user is redirected to the shop page
