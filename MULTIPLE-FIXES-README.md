# Multiple Fixes Implementation

This branch addresses several issues identified in the EmrickScents website. Below is a summary of the changes made:

## Issue 1: Homepage Overlap on Mobile

**Problem:** The homepage was extending horizontally on mobile devices, causing sideways scrolling.

**Solution:**
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to the main container in App.jsx
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to the body element in index.css
- These changes prevent horizontal scrolling while maintaining the layout integrity

## Issue 2: Product Card Size

**Problem:** Product cards appeared oversized, especially on mobile devices.

**Solution:**
- Added `max-h-[280px]` to the product image container to limit height
- Reduced text size from `text-lg` to `text-base` for product titles
- Added responsive CSS in enhanced-styles.css to adjust product card size on mobile:
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .product-card {
      max-width: 90%;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
  }
  ```

## Issue 3: Google Maps Embed Fix

**Problem:** Google Maps embed was not displaying on Netlify due to Content Security Policy (CSP) issues.

**Solution:**
- Updated CSP in netlify.toml and netlify-preview.toml to include frame-src directives:
  ```
  frame-src https://www.google.com https://maps.google.com;
  ```
- This allows Google Maps iframes to load properly within the application

## Issue 4: Product Page URL

**Problem:** Product pages were using IDs in URLs instead of more SEO-friendly product names.

**Solution:**
- Created a utility function in `src/utils/slugify.js` to convert product names to URL-friendly slugs
- Added a new route in App.jsx: `<Route path="/p/:slug" element={<ProductDetails />} />`
- Updated product links in EnhancedProductCard.jsx to use slugified names
- Implemented backward compatibility in ProductDetails.jsx to handle both ID and slug-based URLs
- Added automatic redirection from ID-based URLs to slug-based URLs

## Issue 5: Product Page Slider

**Problem:** After deployment to Netlify, the swipe/arrow icons disappeared from the product page slider.

**Solution:**
- Created custom CSS for Swiper in `src/components/swiper-custom.css`
- Imported the custom CSS in EnhancedProductDetails.jsx
- Updated Swiper configuration to explicitly define navigation elements
- Added custom styling for navigation arrows, pagination bullets, and thumbnail slides

## Testing

All changes have been tested and verified to work correctly. The website now:
- Displays properly on mobile without horizontal scrolling
- Shows appropriately sized product cards on all devices
- Loads Google Maps embeds correctly
- Uses SEO-friendly URLs for product pages
