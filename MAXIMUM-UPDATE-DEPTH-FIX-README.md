# Maximum Update Depth Fix Implementation

This branch fixes the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error that was causing navigation issues in the application. This error occurs when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but the useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render, creating an infinite loop.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. SearchOverlay.jsx Issues
- **Problem**: The component was updating state in useEffect without proper dependency checks, causing infinite re-renders.
- **Solution**:
  - Added a `useCallback` to memoize the filter function
  - Added a reference to track previous input values to prevent unnecessary updates
  - Optimized the input change handler to reduce state updates
  - Improved the product filtering logic to avoid unnecessary re-renders

### 2. SearchContext.jsx Issues
- **Problem**: The context was updating state in useEffect without proper checks, and some functions were recreated on every render.
- **Solution**:
  - Added `useCallback` for all functions to prevent unnecessary recreations
  - Added reference tracking to prevent unnecessary state updates
  - Implemented a debounced approach for localStorage and sessionStorage updates
  - Added proper initialization checks to prevent double-loading from storage
  - Added checks to skip updates when values haven't actually changed

### 3. ReactiveShop.jsx Issues
- **Problem**: The component was filtering products on every render, causing excessive re-renders.
- **Solution**:
  - Memoized the filter function with `useCallback`
  - Added reference tracking to compare previous and current filters
  - Only updated filtered products when filters or search params actually changed
  - Optimized animations to only run when the product list length changes
  - Added proper dependency arrays to all useEffect hooks

## Key Optimization Techniques Used

1. **Reference Tracking**: Using `useRef` to store previous values and compare them with current values to prevent unnecessary updates.

2. **Memoization**: Using `useCallback` to memoize functions and prevent them from being recreated on every render.

3. **Dependency Array Optimization**: Ensuring all useEffect hooks have proper dependency arrays that only include values that should trigger the effect.

4. **State Update Batching**: Batching state updates to reduce the number of renders.

5. **Conditional Updates**: Only updating state when values have actually changed.

6. **Debounced Storage Updates**: Using timeouts to debounce localStorage and sessionStorage updates.

## Testing Results

The changes have been tested and now:
1. Navigation works properly - clicking links immediately changes the page
2. Search functionality works correctly without causing infinite loops
3. Filtering products works smoothly without performance issues
4. No "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in the console
