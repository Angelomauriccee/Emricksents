# Social Homepage Fixes Implementation

This branch implements several modifications to the homepage and other components of the EmerickScents perfume store website.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Social Media Updates
- Removed Twitter and YouTube links from the footer and mobile menu
- Kept only Instagram and Facebook links
- Updated Instagram links to point to https://www.instagram.com/emrickscents?igsh=YzljYTk1ODg3Zg==
- Updated Instagram gallery section to link to the correct account

### 2. Currency Updates
- Verified all homepage product cards display Nigerian Naira (₦)
- Ensured consistent currency formatting across the site

### 3. Section Removals
- Removed the Fragrance notes section from the homepage
- Removed the Shipping fee in cart section
- Removed the Best selling section/category from the shop page

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness Improvements
- Enhanced search function on mobile devices to be more responsive
- Fixed search bar overlap issues on mobile devices
- Improved spacing and sizing for mobile search results
- Added better padding and margins for mobile view

### 5. Footer Collections
- Updated footer collections to filter reactively without requiring a page refresh
- Ensured consistent behavior with the FilterContext

### 6. Category Filter Enhancements
- Modified the category filter to display products based on two conditions:
  1. Product's category field matches the selected category
  2. Product's name field contains the category name (case-insensitive)
- Added a new `filterProductsByCategory` function to the FilterContext
- Updated ReactiveShop.jsx to use the new filtering function

## Example Use Cases for Category Filter

The enhanced category filter now works with the following scenarios:

- If the category is "Chanel", it will display products like "Bleu de Chanel Paris", "Chanel Paris Coco Mademoiselles", and "Chanel No. 5"
- If the category is "Guerlain", it will display "L'homme Idéal de Guerlain Paris" because "guerlain" exists in the product name

## Testing

The changes have been tested on various screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and proper functionality. A preview deployment is available for testing.
