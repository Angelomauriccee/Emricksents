# Navigation Fix Implementation

This branch fixes the navigation issues that occurred after merging all the branches into the main branch. The issue was that clicking links would update the URL but not change the page, and the only way to navigate was to open the search bar and type, which would then redirect to the last clicked page.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. SearchOverlay.jsx Updates
- Fixed the navigation handling in the SearchOverlay component
- Ensured proper use of React Router's navigation
- Added a dedicated `handleProductClick` function to properly handle product link clicks
- Updated the `onRecentSearchClick` function to navigate immediately after clicking a recent search

### 2. SearchNavbar.jsx Updates
- Added `useNavigate` hook to properly handle navigation
- Changed the Shop button from a regular button to a Link component
- Updated `handleBrandSelect` and `handleCollectionSelect` functions to use the navigate function
- Added explicit navigation to the Shop page after filter selection
- Added onClick handlers to mobile menu links to close the menu after navigation

### 3. ReactiveFooter.jsx Updates
- Added `useNavigate` hook for proper navigation
- Changed collection links from Link components to buttons with onClick handlers
- Updated `handleCollectionClick` and `handleNewArrivalsClick` functions to use the navigate function
- Ensured proper navigation to the Shop page after filter selection

### 4. App.jsx Updates
- Ensured proper setup of AnimatePresence and Routes
- Maintained the key prop on Routes to ensure proper page transitions

## Root Cause Analysis

The navigation issue was caused by:
1. Improper handling of React Router navigation in some components
2. Conflicts between different navigation approaches after merging multiple branches
3. Some components using direct URL manipulation instead of React Router's navigation API

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. Clicking any category or nav link from the homepage immediately switches to the correct page
2. Opening search and searching for a product shows results as expected
3. Switching between category links after a search works correctly
4. Navigation works properly on both desktop and mobile devices
